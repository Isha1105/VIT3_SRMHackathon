# VIT3_SRMHackathon
The Project mainly focuses on Smart Irrigation system monitoring on field conditions like humidity, temperature and soil moisture level. Since the project was implemented in online mode due to restrictions caused by covid pandemic, The Project is implemented into two parts- 1. Simulation for the sensors and controlling of peripherals, 2. Hardware implementation of cloud connection using esp8266 to transfer the lm35 sensor data to prove the fact that sensor data can be monitored as well as controlled remotely using IoT based cloud applications.
The simulation is done in Proteus whereas the coding part was done in arduino IDE.
The system is designed specially considering the conditions required for drip irrigation system and can be extended for modern day agricultural practices like Hydrponics and aeroponics with some changes. A smart system for Hydroponics irrigation can be considered the future scope of this project.
